## Security Measures

- **Static Analysis**: [gosec](https://github.com/securego/gosec) runs on every PR and push to main
- **Vulnerability Scanning**: [govulncheck](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/vuln/cmd/govulncheck) checks for known Go vulnerabilities
- **Fuzz Testing**: [ClusterFuzzLite](https://google.github.io/clusterfuzzlite/) continuously fuzzes service and gateway handlers
- **Code Scanning**: GitHub CodeQL analysis on every PR
- **Dependency Pinning**: All CI actions and tools are pinned by hash
- **Dependency Updates**: Dependabot monitors for outdated and vulnerable dependencies
- **Authorization**: Default-deny (`DenyAll`) authorizer; must be explicitly configured

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We use GitHub's **[Private Vulnerability Reporting](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing-information-about-vulnerabilities/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability)**.

Please **do not** open a public issue for security bugs. Instead:

1. Go to the **[Security](https://github.com/rbaliyan/config-server/security)** tab of this repository.
2. Click on **[Advisories](https://github.com/rbaliyan/config-server/security/advisories)** on the left sidebar.
3. Click **Report a vulnerability**.

This allows you to share the details privately with the maintainers.
